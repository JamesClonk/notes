| [Café Oli - Honduras – COMSA Blend](https://cafeoli.ch/produit/honduras-comsa-blend/) | 100% Arabica, Honduras (Parainema, Lempira, IHCAFE 90, Catuai, Icatu, Tipica, Pache, Bourbon and Catimor blend), medium roast, <ins>dark chocolate</ins>, low fruity, sweet/creamy, smooth, low citric, low bitter<br/>🌕️ Coffee-only | With AeroPress: pleasant bitterness, full of chocolatey flavors, unbelievably delicious with milk!<br/>Bit of a dry-mouth effect with V60, less smooth but overall very tasty, somewhat "full", lots of texture, even pure without any milk. Though with milk it might be even better than AeroPress brewed!<br/>Doesn't work for Espresso, always sour.<br/><br/>:+1: Best with An4msR16C20-22, and milk<br/>:+1: or V60R16C20, ___and___ milk | An4msR17C16 = 5x<br/>An4msR15C22 = 5x<br/>An4msR16C26 = 5x<br/>V60R16C22 = 5x<br/>~E18.7gC10->28s42g = 2x<br/>E14gC9->20s42g = 2x~ |
| [Café Oli - Ethiopia – Tega & Tula](https://cafeoli.ch/produit/ethiopia-tega-tula/) | 100% Arabica, Ethiopia, medium roast, very <ins>fruity</ins> and citric, acidic, low bitter | Fantastic coffee, very tasty. Fruity, pleasant, light, works well standalone for a large cup. As long as you know what to expect (fruity tea-like taste, not suited for milk!) it works well.<br/><br/>V60 is a bit less fruity than AeroPress, slightly more heavy and dry-mouth feel. Both are fine, just slightly different. Usually I prefer the AeroPress taste, but depending on my mood the V60 is nice too.<br/><br/>:+1: Best with An4msR16C22, pure | An4msR17C22 = 5x<br/>V60R17C20 = 5x<br/>V60R18C30 = 4x |
| [Café Oli - Mexico – San Alfonso](https://cafeoli.ch/produit/mexico-san-alfonso/) | 100% Arabica, Mexico (Marsellesa and Caturra blend), medium-darkish roast, <ins>caramel</ins>/chocolate, sweet, rough, creamy, low fruity, low citric | Smokey, full mouth-feel, with a tiny amount of fruitiness. Delicious pure from V60.<br/>Stored currently in the black vacuum box.<br/><br/>:+1: Best with An4msR16C22, and milk<br/>:+1: or V60R17C22, pure | An4msR15C16 = 5x<br/>An4msR14C22 = 5x<br/>An4msR20C22 = 5x<br/>V60R17C22 = 5x |

| [Café Oli - Colombia – Bahareque Torra](https://cafeoli.ch/produit/colombia-torra/) | 100% Arabica, Colombia (Castillo, Colombia and Caturra blend), medium roast, citric, fruity, smokey, not sweet, acidic<br/>🌕️ Coffee-only | fruity but still pleasant, with a <ins>smokey-citrus</ins> taste, rough texture. Overall the most "classical" taste of all the Café Olis.<br/>V60 produces a bitter, rough aftertaste. (Probably needs coarser grind than the tested C22)<br/>Doesn't work for Espresso, result is way too sour, undrinkable.<br/><br/>:+1: Best with An4msR16C20-22, and a splash of milk | An4msR17C20 = 4-5x<br/>V60R16C22 = 4x<br/>Ap38gR11C26 = 3x<br/>~E18gC9->30s37g = 2x~ |
| [MAME - El Paraiso Red - Filter](https://mame.coffee/collections/coffee/products/el-paraiso-red-filter) | 100% Arabica, Colombia, light roast, natural/fermented, very fruity (<ins>hibiscus/rosehips</ins>, not citrusy), acidic, creamy, low bitter<br/>🌕️ Coffee-only | Very strong fruit (rosehips, pomegranate) tea like smell, and a _very buttery_, creamy mouth-feel. Covers and clings strangely to the tongue in aftertaste. It is objectively certainly good coffee, very good fruit notes. But subjectively, the creamy buttery aftertaste is rather off-putting, just not for me. 😓<br/><br/>Waiting a few more days for the beans to degas, and then using C20 with V60 seems to help, there's less creamy buttery mouth-feel now.<br/><br/>:+1: Best with An4msR17C22, pure | An4msR17C20 = 4x<br/>An4msR17C22 = 4x<br/>V60R16C28 = 3-4x<br/>V60R17C20 = 4x |
| [Turm - Peru - Villa Ecologica](https://shop.turmkaffee.ch/kaffee/peru-coop-villa-ecologica.html) | 100% Arabica, Peru, medium roast, <ins>earthy</ins>, no fruit, low acidity, light sweet, light nutty, light bitter | 20-22 clicks on [C40](https://www.comandantegrinder.com/) for grind size, mild and pleasant taste, no bad acidity, no fruitiness, works well with hot milk and milk foam -> delicious!<br/>(Mario's comment: Marroni)<br/>V60 pure is surprisingly not bad either, has maybe a slight bitterish head-dizziness, but only very slightly. Otherwise nice texture.<br/><br/>:+1: Best with E14-18gC9, and milk | Ai3mbR16.6C20 = 4x<br/>An4msR17C22 = 4x<br/>V60R17C22 = 4x<br/>E14gC9->22s42g = 3x<br/>~E17gC9->24s44g = 2x~<br/>E18gC9->42s43g = 3x |
| [Turm - Brazil - Yellow Bourbon](https://shop.turmkaffee.ch/kaffee/brazil-yellow-burbon.html) | 100% Arabica, Brazil (Yellow Bourbon), medium roast, <ins>nutty</ins>, light fruity, low acidity, low bitter, sweet | pretty "classical" taste profile, nothing standing out too much, a bit rough texture. not smooth/clear, slightly bitter at the very end. Try to mask the final bitterness with a dash of milk.<br/>but mostly harmless.. | An4msR17C22 = 4x |
| [Turm - India - Monsooned Malabar](https://shop.turmkaffee.ch/kaffee/india-monsooned.html) | 100% Arabica, India, medium-dark roast, <ins>tobacco</ins>, smokey, earthy, low/no acidity, some bitter | clear but rough, smokey texture and tobacco-like taste. It's okay, but probably not my favorite, certainly not pure. Add a splash of milk to mute the bitterness/earthiness. | An4msR17C22 = 3-4x |
| [Stoll Classic - Nero](https://www.stoll-kaffee.ch/produkt/nero/) | 84% Arabica / 16% Robusta, ???(Arabica) - India(Robusta), dark roast, chocolatey, <ins>nutty</ins>, sweet, spices, some bitter, no fruit/acidity<br/>🌑 Espresso-only | E18gC9 took 60s but surprisingly it was good! No unpleasant aftertaste or anything, just a nutty, creamy flavor with some bitterness (but not too much). Me thinks my tastebuds tend to favor darker roasts for Espresso, probably..<br/>C10 took normal shot time, but was slightly more sour. Maybe I should _immediately_ stop a shot asap once the 2nd angry chimney steam starts?<br/>Interestingly not super great with milk, just okay<br/><br/>:+1: Best with E18gC9, and 1 grain of salt | E18gC9->60s32g = 4x<br/>E18gC10->28s38g = 4x |

| [MAME - Pearl - Espresso](https://mame.coffee/collections/espresso/products/test-of-gilberto-espresso) | 100% Arabica, Brazil, medium-dark roast, natural, <ins>chocolatey</ins>, smokey, creamy, nutty, low acidity<br/>🌑 Espresso-only | Smells very chocolatey, beans are small-ish somehow.<br/>Stored currently in the white vacuum box.<br/><br/>C10 resulted in a very sour shot. Ignoring the sourness, it does have a nice nutty-chocolate taste though. C9 however produces a very long shot (1min), overextracted and bitter. | E18gC10->25s42g = 3x<br/>E18gC9->60s36g = 2-3x |
| [Stoll Classic - Hausmischung](https://www.stoll-kaffee.ch/produkt/hausmischung/) | 100% Arabica, Brazil - Ethiopia - Columbia - Costa Rica, medium-darkish roast, citric/sour, sweet, acidity, <ins>bitter</ins> | Aimed at Café Crème (and maybe Lungo), not really for pure Espresso.<br/>E18gC10 was sour, not overwhelming but still a bit sour, and also slightly bitter. Likely much better as a Lungo to get rid of the sourness, or as an Americano | E18gC10->25s38g = 3x |
| [Adrianos - Silvestre](https://adrianos.ch/shop/kaffee/bohnen/silvestre-bohnen) | 100% Arabica, Brazil (Yellow Icatu), some fruitiness, some acidity | pre-ground bought, medium grind (Bialetti coarseness according to Adrianos store), not bad but not great either, pretty <ins>meh</ins> overall, mild fruity/acidic/citric aftertaste, otherwise maybe too bland (could be grind/prep's fault though) | An2mbR16.6 |

## Usage / Methods - code matrix

- R_ = Ratio, example 16.7 -> 12g/200ml
- A = AeroPress
  - n = normal
  - i = inverted
  - p = PuckPuck cold brew
  - _m = time
  - b = +bloom/stir (usually 30s)
  - s = +stir at start only
- B = Bialetti / Moka pot
- E = Espresso / 9bar
  - _g = grams of coffee
  - ->_s_g = shot time and grams of result
- P = E.S.E. pads
- F = French Press
- H = Hario / drip|filter coffee
  - V = V60
- Ch = Chemex
- Cxx = Comandante [C40](https://www.comandantegrinder.com/) click settings
- 👍️ = this is how to use that coffee, determined after lengthy research process 😆

## General notes

Starting points for dialing in:
- C40 clicks for 9barista: 7-14
- C40 clicks for Bialetti: 16-20 (may go as high as 30 though)
- C40 clicks for AeroPress, standard: 16-24
- C40 clicks for AeroPress, inverted: 22-28
- C40 clicks for V60: 20-25 (a bit coarser for darker roasts)

General observations of differences in brewing methods:
- Basic AeroPress recipes generally produce a more "clear", smooth, watery, fruity result. Suited well for fruity coffees.
- V60 produces more "full", dry-mouth, texture, heavy result than AeroPress. Suited well for milk-intended coffees.
- Bialetti generally produces very heavy, earthy, bitter results. Viable only for milk-required coffees.
- 9barista so far never worked well with light roasts and/or fruity beans, seems to prefer dark and earthy. Suited for darker roasts.

An4msR16C20 vs V60R16C22:
The basic AeroPress recipe has better citrus taste, less texture, less dry-mouth, more watery but more fruitiness. Overall I think the default AeroPress recipe is "clearer" and better for fruity coffees than default V60 recipe, but V60R18C28 got close (higher than "normal" ratios seem to make it closer through being more watery?). Overall C20-22 is probably best for a V60, while C18-20 the best starting point for an AeroPress.

##### Wait time for freshly roasted beans
- Espresso 12 days+
- Filter 5 days+

###### dark roast
- as fresh as possible
- after 1-3 days old it is already beyond the degassing levels of medium and light roasts
- it starts to oxidize and really taste acrid/bitter after a week

###### medium roast
- min. 5-7 days for filter coffee, and 7-10 days for Espresso
- usually lasts at least a month or two before noticeable deterioration of flavours

###### light roast
- 10 - 14 days for filter and 14 days+ for Espressos

---

#### AeroPress base process:

- put filter in cap, screw cap onto base
- pour coffee into base, 12g, shake to even level
- put base onto cup
- pour hot water into base (95-100c), 200g
- stir with tool for 2-3s (important for even extraction!)
- put plunger in for vacuum
- wait 3min
- gently swirl a few times
- wait 20s
- slowly push plunger, until all water has left (stop at the hiss!)
- done, enjoy! 😋👌

---

#### V60 process:

- base recipe: 15g beans, 250g water, 16.6 ratio
- when in doubt, use C22 as base grind size
- rinse filter paper
- heat water
  - the darker it gets the lower the temps
  - down to 80-85c (maybe up to 90c) for darker rossts
  - 90-95c for medium roasts
  - 95-100c for light roasts
- preheat V60 cup
- put hot V60 cup on caraffe, add rinsed filter paper
- add coffee, dig small mound in middle
- 0:00 - pour 50g (use simple circular pouring for all pours!)
- 0:10-0:15 - gently swirl
- reset time (makes keeping track easier for the intervals)
- 0:00-0:45 - bloom
- 0:45-1:00 - pour 50g (100g total)
- 1:00-1:10 - wait
- 1:10-1:20 - pour 50g (150g total)
- 1:20-1:30 - wait
- 1:30-1:40 - pour 50g (200g total)
- 1:40-1:50 - wait
- 1:50-2:00 - pour 50g (250g total)
- 2:00-2:05 - gently swirl
- 2:05-3:00 - let it drain
- 3:00+ - should be done roughly after hitting the 3min. mark

---

#### 9barista process:

- don't push rubber cover on portafilter basket all the way in, ideally it shouldn't touch the puck
- without adaptor-plate on smallest glass-ceramic
- set to highest heat
- wait till first angry steam blow from chimney
- see Espresso appearing and start timer
- ~25-35s later the second angry steam blow from chimney should happen / have happened by then
- immediately take off of heat once second angry steam blow subsides, stop timer
- pour shot into glass
- enjoy! (or not.. 🤣)
