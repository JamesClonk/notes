## General TODO:

- [ ] Try next AeroPress with a large dose - low ratio recipe. For example inverted, very coarse grind (C28-30), 30g, add 50ml, bloom, add remaining 100-200ml, stir, wait 2min, swirl, wait 30s, push through.
  - note: this might a) be more suitable for darker roasts / heavier coffees, b) might not be good regardless. it favors different things and tastes. Use with caution.

  - b = +bloom/stir (usually 30s)
  - s = +stir at start only
- B = Bialetti / Moka pot
- E = Espresso / 9bar
  - _g = grams of coffee
  - ->_s_g = shot time and grams of result
- P = E.S.E. pads
- F = French Press

  - V = V60
- Ch = Chemex
- Cxx = Comandante [C40](https://www.comandantegrinder.com/) click settings
- üëçÔ∏è = this is how to use that coffee, determined after lengthy research process üòÜ

## General notes

Starting points for dialing in:
- C40 clicks for 9barista: 7-14
- C40 clicks for Bialetti: 16-20 (may go as high as 30 though)
- C40 clicks for AeroPress, standard: 18-24
- C40 clicks for AeroPress, inverted: 22-28
- C40 clicks for V60: 18-22 (a bit coarser for darker roasts)

##### Wait time for freshly roasted beans
- Espresso 12 days+
- Filter 5 days+

###### dark roast
- as fresh as possible
- after 1-3 days old it is already beyond the degassing levels of medium and light roasts
- it starts to oxidize and really taste acrid/bitter after a week

###### medium roast
- min. 5-7 days for filter coffee, and 7-10 days for Espresso
- usually lasts at least a month or two before noticeable deterioration of flavours

###### light roast
- 10 - 14 days for filter and 14 days+ for Espressos

---

#### V60 process:

- base recipe: 15g beans, 250g water
- when in doubt, use C18-20 as base grind size
- rinse filter paper
- heat water
  - only ultra light roasts need 100c water
  - the darker it gets the lower the temps, down to 80c for very dark rossts. 
  - try 95c as default
- preheat V60 cup
- put hot V60 cup on caraffe, add rinsed filter paper
- add coffee, dig small mound in middle
- 0:00 - pour 50g
- 0:10-0:15 - gently swirl
- reset time (makes keeping track easier for the intervals)
- 0:00-0:45 - bloom
- 0:45-1:00 - pour 50g (100g total)
- 1:00-1:10 - wait
- 1:10-1:20 - pour 50g (150g total)
- 1:20-1:30 - wait
- 1:30-1:40 - pour 50g (200g total)
- 1:40-1:50 - wait
- 1:50-2:00 - pour 50g (250g total)
- 2:00-2:05 - gently swirl
- 2:05-3:00 - let it drain
- 3:00+ - should be done roughly after hitting the 3min. mark

---

#### 9barista process:

- don't push rubber cover on portafilter basket all the way in, ideally it shouldn't touch the puck
- without adaptor-plate on smallest glass-ceramic
- set to highest heat
- wait till first angry steam blow from chimney
- see Espresso appearing and start timer
- ~25s later the second angry steam blow from chimney should happen / have happened by then
- immediately take off of heat once second angry steam blow subsides, stop timer
- pour shot into glass
- enjoy! (or not.. ü§£)
