As a rule of thumb, if your street shoe size is 42.5, go with 41's for La Sportiva and 41.5-42's for Scarpa.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Street|Shoe|42.5|‚úÖ|standing, walking, running, hiking|default street shoe size|01.1970|
|La Sportiva|Mythos|41|‚úÖ|sport climbing, outdoor|okayish rock/trad allrounder, extremly comfy (can be worn 4-5h without a break no problem!), can do indoor rope-climbing well too. I used to use it for indoor bouldering too, but for anything other than a beginner its not matching that discipline well|12.2023|
|La Sportiva|Katana <sub>*(-2023)*</sub>|41|‚úÖ|allrounder, bouldering, sport climbing, indoor, outdoor|good allrounder, can do pretty much anything reasonable but not perfect, somewhat comfy enough at size 41 (but not for ulra-long wearing like a Mythos), at 40.5 it has more performance but pains your toes|11.2023|
|La Sportiva|Katana <sub>*(2024+)*</sub>|41|-|allrounder, bouldering, sport climbing, indoor, outdoor|newer version, unknown fit and performance for now. expecting to be the same as pre-2024 katana (hopefully)|-|
|Scarpa|Vapor V|42|‚úÖ|allrounder, bouldering, sport climbing, indoor|good allrounder, similar to but more "performance" oriented than a katana, slightly more asymetrical/pointy|02.2024|
|Scarpa|Vapor S|‚ùìÔ∏è|-|bouldering, sport climbing, indoor|expecting a good and convenient indoor allrounder, probably very nice for my bouldering level. I'd love to try it on somewhere, but couldn't find a store yet that has these üòû|-|
|Scarpa|Vapor|‚ùìÔ∏è|-|allrounder-ish, rock, sport climbing, indoor-ish, outdoor|expecting a good sport/rock climber shoe|-|
|Scarpa|Veloce|41.5-42|‚úÖ|bouldering, indoor|bouldering-focused, excellent smearing, slight downturn, a bit crunchy toebox (üò¢), good intermediate performance. I had it at size 41.5 but with toe pain after just a few routes, can't be worn too long, only for short time to do some critical sends. Maybe size 42 would alleviate the toe pain, but then might be loose? When in doubt stick with 41.5, its proven to work (and ignore your toes crying)|12.2023|
|Scarpa|Arpia V|41.5 - 42|-|bouldering, sport climbing, indoor|good indoor boulderer. size 41.5 feels snug, but pains toes slightly on the side. size 42 doesn't, but can feel a bit floaty / too loose unfortunately|03.2024|
|Scarpa|Instinct VS|42|-|bouldering, sport climbing, indoor|expecting a highly performance oriented indoor allrounder. size 42 seemed to fit during testing|02.2024|
|Scarpa|Quantix SF|‚ùìÔ∏è|-|bouldering, sport climbing, indoor|expecting a reasonable indoor allrounder|-|
