|Street|Shoe|42.5|‚úÖ|standing, walking, running, hiking|default street shoe size|01.1970|
|La Sportiva|Mythos|41|‚úÖ|sport climbing, outdoor|okayish rock/trad allrounder, extremy comfy (can be worn 4-5h without a break no problem!), can do indoor rope-climbing well too. I used to use it for indoor bouldering too, but for anything other than a beginner its not matching that discipline well|12.2023|
|La Sportiva|Katana <sub>*(-2023)*</sub>|41|‚úÖ|allrounder, bouldering, sport climbing, indoor, outdoor|good allrounder, can do pretty much anything reasonable but not perfect, somewhat comfy enough at size 41 (but not for ulra-long wearing like a Mythos), at 40.5 it has more performance but pains your toes faster|11.2023|
|La Sportiva|Katana <sub>*(2024+)*</sub>|41|-|allrounder, bouldering, sport climbing, indoor, outdoor|newer version, unknown fit and performance for now|-|
|Scarpa|Vapor V|42|‚úÖ|allrounder, bouldering, sport climbing, indoor|good allrounder, similar to but more "performance" oriented than a katana, slightly more asymetrical/pointy|02.2024|
|Scarpa|Vapor S|‚ùìÔ∏è|-|bouldering, sport climbing, indoor|expecting a good good indoor allrounder|-|
|Scarpa|Vapor|‚ùìÔ∏è|-|allrounder-ish, rock, sport climbing, indoor-ish, outdoor|expecting a good sport/rock climber shoe|-|
|Scarpa|Veloce|42|‚úÖ|bouldering, indoor|bouldering-focused, excellent smearing, slight downturn, a bit crunchy toebox (üò¢), good intermediate performance|12.2023|
