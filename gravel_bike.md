# gravel bike

## requirements

- low gear ratio (approx. 0.85 or less), for easy climbing. the most important criteria of all..
- approx. 10kg or less in weight (not thaaaaat important)
- shimano cassette, 11 or 12 gears, from the GRX series, minimum 45T, 50/51T preferable. the 12-speed components would be very highly preferred! (99% chance of 11-speed not being acceptable)
- shimano 1 fixed front gear/crankset, from the GRX series, maximum 40T, matching the casette, shifters, derailleur, etc.
- shimano shifters and derailleur, from the GRX series, preferrably RX822/820 components, but RX610 is acceptable too. (for 12-speed. for 11-speed it would be RX812/810 and RX600 respectively)
- handlebar with at least 40cm width, up to 44cm, 42cm would be preferred. with a reasonable amount of flare.
- carbon fork
- reasonable amount of attachment points on frame for future potential bikepacking
- wheels, 27.5" or 28", 28 would highly preferred though. (much higher suitable tire choices available for 28!)
- tires to be continental terra trail|speed, or schwalbe g-one, or similar, could be 35-45 but ideally 40 wide.
- preference for aluminium over carbon fiber due to robustness. titanium would also be awesome. steel probably too heavy.
- preference for a somewhat more relaxed frame geometry vs. it being aggressive. My wrists, back and neck do _not_ like full-on racing bike geometry.
