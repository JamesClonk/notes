| [Caf√© Oli - Honduras ‚Äì COMSA Blend](https://cafeoli.ch/produit/honduras-comsa-blend/) | 100% Arabica (Parainema, Lempira, IHCAFE 90, Catuai, Icatu, Tipica, Pache, Bourbon and Catimor blend), Honduras, medium roast, <ins>dark chocolate</ins>, low fruity, sweet/creamy, smooth, low citric, low bitter<br/>üåïÔ∏è Coffee-only<br/>ü•õ Milk-favorite | With AeroPress: pleasant bitterness, full of chocolatey flavors, unbelievably delicious with milk!<br/>Bit of a dry-mouth effect with V60, less smooth but overall very tasty, somewhat "full", lots of texture, even pure without any milk. Though with milk it might be even better than AeroPress brewed!<br/>Doesn't work for Espresso, always sour.<br/><br/>:+1: Best with An4msR16C20-22, and milk<br/>:+1: or V60p5R16C20T95, ___and___ milk | An4msR17C16 = 5x<br/>An4msR15C22 = 5x<br/>An4msR16C26 = 5x<br/>V60p5R16C22T95 = 5x<br/>~E18.7gC10->28s42g = 2x<br/>E14gC9->20s42g = 2x~ |
| [Caf√© Oli - Ethiopia ‚Äì Tega & Tula](https://cafeoli.ch/produit/ethiopia-tega-tula/) | 100% Arabica, Ethiopia, medium roast, very <ins>fruity</ins> and citric, acidic, low bitter<br/>üåïÔ∏è Coffee-only | Fantastic coffee, very tasty. Fruity, pleasant, light, works well standalone for a large cup. As long as you know what to expect (fruity tea-like taste, not suited for milk!) it works well.<br/><br/>V60 is a bit less fruity than AeroPress, slightly more heavy and dry-mouth feel. Both are fine, just slightly different. Usually I prefer the AeroPress taste, but depending on my mood the V60 is nice too.<br/><br/>:+1: Best with An4msR16C22, pure | An4msR17C22 = 5x<br/>V60p5R17C20T94 = 5x<br/>V60p5R18C30T95 = 4x |
| [Drip Roasters - Ethiopia Nano Challa](https://www.driproasters.ch/de/kaffee/filter/ethiopia-nano-challa-filter-250g) | 100% Arabica, Ethiopia - Jimma - Genji Challa, light roast, washed, fruity, <ins>citrusy</ins>, acidic, floral, light berry | Great coffee! Has a fruity and slightly floral citrus taste, with a hint of berries. Very balanced, clear vs. rough.<br/>Very light even on a V60. AeroPress has a slightly more berry and a just very slightly creamy aftertaste. Odd though that in V60 even with C24 the drawdown is much slower than expected (almost 4min total time!).<br/>Lower temps seem to work well here despite being a light roast.<br/><br/>:+1: Best with V60p4R17C24T93, pure<br/>:+1: or [Ai40sbR7.5C30T92](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEOOCkU01A8), pure | Ai40sbR7.5C30T92 = 5x<br/>An4msR17C22 = 5x<br/>V60p5R17C24T98 = 4-5x<br/>V60p4R17C24T93 = 5x<br/>V60p5R17C24T93 = 5x<br/>V60p4R17C22T92 = 5x |
| [Square Mile - La Serran√≠a](https://shop.squaremilecoffee.com/pages/our-pick-filter-subscription-coffees-2022) | 100% Arabica (Caturra, Colombia, Castillo), Colombia - Hulia, light roast, washed, <ins>apple-ish</ins>, plum, fruity, low acidity, very sweet, low bitter | Smells like red fruits or cooked apple. V60 brew had a sweet, juicy taste and very tea-like lightness to it.<br/>To my surprise with the AeroPress on the other hand it was more astringent, a bit less juicy. Grinding coarser removed some of that astringency, but also lost a bit of juicyness and the apple-ish taste.. Seems to work way better in a V60! (might possibly be due to the lower temp). Drink it once its at lower temps (below 60) to enjoy to the fullest..<br/>Ai40sbR7.5C30T92 turns it into an insane fruit-bomb, but its a bit too overpowered that way..<br/><br/>:+1: Best with V60p5R17C24T93, pure | Ai40sbR7.5C30T92 = 4x<br/>An4msR17C20 = 4x<br/>An4msR17C22 = 4x<br/>V60p5R17C24T94 = 5x<br/>V60p5R17C24T93 = 5x<br/>V60p5R17C22T93 = 4-5x<br/>V60p5R17C24T99 = 4x |
| [Square Mile - La Cidra](https://shop.squaremilecoffee.com/pages/our-pick-filter-subscription-coffees-2023) | 100% Arabica (Catuai), Honduras - Lempira, medium roast, washed, apple, blackcurrant, chocolatey, some nutty, low acidity, low bitter | With Aeropress: not fruity, clear and juicy, but astringent and a slightly dry-mouth aftertaste. A classical taste profile, with light nuttyness and chocolate feel, but just lightly.<br/>At lower AeroPress grind settings it gets too bitter for my taste (It is a medium roast after all). Personally I wouldn't go below C20 with T100. (Or only if milk gets involved, then it becomes delicious though!). <br/>On the other hand C24 has a slightly soupy taste, less bitter/astringent but a bit weak and more watered-down. Some people might like it, it's not "wrong", just different.<br/><br/>V60 is a bit a different picture. Just like with the previous coffee from Square Mile, it seems to work much better in a pour-over. It produces a mainly <ins>juicy</ins>, clear and sweet umami-like cup. Delicious!<br/><br/>:+1: Best with V60p5R17C23T94, pure | An4msR17C16 = 4x<br/>An4msR17C20 = 4x<br/>An4msR17C24 = 4x<br/>V60p5R17C22T93 = 4-5x<br/>V60p5R17C22T94 = 4-5x<br/>V60p5R17C23T94 = 5x<br/>V60p5R17C24T94 = 4-5x |
| [Drip Roasters - Ecuador Maputo 2](https://www.driproasters.ch/de/kaffee/filter/ecuador-maputo-2-filter-250g) | 100% Arabica (Typica), Ecuador - Nanegal, light roast, honey method, citrus, <ins>honey</ins>, sweet, fruity tea | Smells very sweet, strongly of honey and some citrus fruit. Sweet citrus tea taste, slightly fruity and fermented, delicious! C20 has too much astringent aftertaste.<br/><br/>Stored currently in the black vacuum box.<br/><br/>:+1: Best with V60p5R17C23T93, pure | An4msR17C20 = ‚ùìÔ∏èx<br/>V60p5R17C20T93 = 4x<br/>V60p5R17C22T93 = 4-5x<br/>V60p5R17C23T93 = 5x |

| [Square Mile - Ozolotepec](https://shop.squaremilecoffee.com/pages/our-pick-filter-subscription-coffees-2023) | 100% Arabica (Pluma Hidalgo, Typica, Bourbon), Mexico - Oaxaca, light-medium roast, washed, apple-ish, almond, chocolatey, nutty, acidic, light sweet, some bitter, light juicy | Acidic and nutty smell, maybe some green apple with almonds? Mild astringency, with a slightly bitter aftertaste, with some notes of chocolate texture. A more traditional coffee, but good!<br/><br/>Stored currently in the white vacuum box.<br/><br/>:+1: Best with V60p5R17C23T93, pure | An4msR17C20 = ‚ùìÔ∏èx<br/>V60p5R17C22T93 = 4x<br/>V60p5R17C22T94 = 4-5x<br/>V60p5R17C24T93 = 4-5x<br/>V60p5R17C23T94 = 4-5x<br/>V60p5R17C24T94 = 4x |
| [Drip Roasters - Colombia Wush Wush Planadas](https://www.driproasters.ch/de/kaffee/filter/colombia-wush-wush-planadas-filter-250g) | 100% Arabica (Wush Wush), Colombia - Tolima - Ibagu√©, medium roast, washed/anaerobic fermented, fruity, <ins>tropical fruits</ins>, strawberry/pineapple, peach-y, berry, sweet, acidic, low bitter | Typical strong tropical fruity smell of natural/fermented coffee beans. Very fruity, but with good overall balance despite the powerful smell.<br/><br/>Using a V60C18T94 recipe as suggested by Drip Roasters tends more towards bitter-ish taste, still quite balanced, but a bit less of the fruit-punchiness. Objectively the C18 is certainly good, but just too much on the bitter side for me personally. I rated it a 4x, for other people who like more "traditional" taste it would probably be a 4-5x.<br/><br/>:+1: Best with V60p5R17C23T94, pure  | An4msR17C20 = 4-5x<br/>V60p5R17C18T94 = 4x<br/>V60p5R17C24T94 = 4-5x<br/>V60p5R17C24T93 = 4-5x |
| [Drip Roasters - Rwanda Kamajumba](https://www.driproasters.ch/de/kaffee/filter/rwanda-kamajumba-filter-250g) | 100% Arabica (Red Bourbon), Rwanda - Nyamasheke, light roast, washed, <ins>orange</ins>, citric, tea, some sweetness, low bitter | Orange/lemon tea-like, clear, slight fruitiness, almost no astringency. Not bad, but could be a bit more fruity. Somewhat muted with V60C24T95. <br/>Overall its simple and tea-like, nothing crazy in any direction, just solid coffee. <br/>V60C22T93 is good, very clean and smooth. (I'm starting to think that the Drip Roasters suggested recipes in general don't fit my taste, all of them have been too rough so far)<br/><br/>:+1: Best with V60p5R17C23T93, pure | An4msR17C20 = 4x<br/>V60p5R17C24T95 = 4x<br/>V60p5R17C23T93 = 4-5x<br/>V60p5R17C22T93 = 4-5x |
| [Caf√© Oli - Mexico ‚Äì San Alfonso](https://cafeoli.ch/produit/mexico-san-alfonso/) | 100% Arabica (Marsellesa and Caturra blend), Mexico, medium-darkish roast, <ins>caramel</ins>/chocolate, sweet, rough, creamy, low fruity, low citric | Smokey, full mouth-feel, with a tiny amount of fruitiness. Delicious pure from V60.<br/><br/>:+1: Best with An4msR16C22, and milk<br/>:+1: or V60p5R17C22T94, pure | An4msR15C16 = 4-5x<br/>An4msR14C22 = 4-5x<br/>An4msR20C22 = 4-5x<br/>V60p5R17C22T94 = 4-5x |
| [Drip Roasters - Ethiopia Bule Adado](https://www.driproasters.ch/de/kaffee/filter/ethiopia-bule-adado-filter-250g) | 100% Arabica (Yirgacheffe - Kudhume, Welisho, Dego), Ethiopia - Bule, light roast, natural/fermented, citric, fruity, <ins>berry</ins>, sweet, no bitter | The fermented taste is strong with this one..<br/>Heavy berry taste, like cherries almost. It's good quality coffee, but the fermented taste is very much an acquired one, and not (yet?) for me for sure!<br/><br/>The funky flavor is more palatable when using hotter temps (probably more bitter compounds extracted and thus better at muting/balancing the rotten berry taste). Either that, or I'm starting to get used to the taste.. üòÇ<br/><br/>..It really seems like I'm getting more used to it, or that having the beans degassing for 1 more week has helped.<br/><br/>:+1: Best with V60p5R17C22T93, pure | An4msR17C22 = 4x<br/>V60p5R17C24T93 = 3-4x<br/>V60p5R17C22T99 = 4x<br/><br/>days later..<br/>An4msR17C18 = 4x<br/>V60p5R17C22T92 = 4-5x |
| [Drip Roasters - Kenya Deman Estate](https://www.driproasters.ch/de/kaffee/filter/kenya-deman-estate-filter-250g) | 100% Arabica (Ruiru 11, Batian), Kenya - Nkubu, light-medium roast, natural, citric, lime, plum, ‚ùìÔ∏è | Does indeed smell like rhubarb as its description said. | An4msR17C20 = ‚ùìÔ∏èx<br/>V60p5R17C22T93 = ‚ùìÔ∏èx<br/>V60p5R17C24T93 = 4x<br/>V60p5R17C23T94 = ‚ùìÔ∏èx |
| [Drip Roasters - Costa Rica La Angostura](https://www.driproasters.ch/de/kaffee/filter/costa-rica-la-angostura-filter-250g) | 100% Arabica (Red Catuai), Costa Rica - Tarraz√∫, medium roast, yellow honey method, plum, <ins>caramel</ins>, red apple, sweet, rough, low fruity, low acidic, low bitter | Beans smell strongly like caramel, while after brewing more like apple. A simple, caramelly-apple tasting cup. Drip Roasters recipe (C21T93) has much caramel and some slightly fruity juiciness, but is not too astringent. Not bad, a slightly more traditional coffee than I like, but does have a more interesting lingerling slightly fruity aftertaste at least compared to the Chijchipani.<br/><br/>:+1: Best with V60p5R17C21T93, pure | V60p5R17C21T93 = 4x<br/>V60p5R17C23T93 = 4x<br/>V60p5R17C24T92 = 4x |
| [Drip Roasters - Bolivia Chijchipani](https://www.driproasters.ch/en/coffee/filter/bolivia-chijchipani-filter-250g) | 100% Arabica (Caturra, Red Catuai, Mundo Novo), Bolivia - Chijchipani - Caranavi, light-medium roast, washed, <ins>nutty</ins>, light earthy, sweet, low acidity, some bitter, umami | A somewhat nutty, slightly bitter-ish taste with some astringency, but overall light and clear. Not chocolate, but maybe in the direction of nougat? Even though this roast cleary is more bitter than my usual speciality coffees its still very light in overall feeling, very well balanced, though with some slightly earthy smell/taste maybe? No fruitiness present.. A more traditional coffee.<br/>The Drip Roasters recommended recipe (V60p5R17C20T93) brews a very nutty nougaty cup, give it a try if you like that type of coffee, then this would be a 4-5x for you.<br/><br/>Stored currently in the airscape box.<br/><br/>:+1: Best with V60p4R17C22T94, and a splash of milk | An4msR17C24 = 4x<br/>V60p5R17C20T93 = 4x<br/>V60p5R17C22T94 = 4x<br/>V60p5R17C24T94 = 4x<br/>V60p5R17C24T93 = 4x |
| [Caf√© Oli - Colombia ‚Äì Bahareque Torra](https://cafeoli.ch/produit/colombia-torra/) | 100% Arabica (Castillo, Colombia and Caturra blend), Colombia, medium roast, citric, fruity, smokey, not sweet, acidic, astringent<br/>üåïÔ∏è Coffee-only | fruity but still pleasant, with a <ins>smokey-citrus</ins> taste, rough texture. Overall the most "classical" taste of all the Caf√© Olis.<br/>V60 produces a bitter, rough aftertaste, too much astringency. ~(Probably needs coarser grind than the tested C22)~ Confirmed: C28 is much more mellow, easier. Still a tiny bit dry-mouth feel, but much more pleasant and clear, no bad aftertaste.<br/>Doesn't work for Espresso, result is way too sour, undrinkable.<br/><br/>:+1: Best with An4msR16C20-22, and a splash of milk | An4msR17C20 = 4-5x<br/>V60p5R16C20T97 = 3-4x<br/>V60p5R16C28T97 = 4x<br/>V60p5R16C22T93 = 4x<br/>Ap38gR11C26 = 3x<br/>~E18gC9->30s37g = 2x~ |
| [MAME - El Paraiso Red - Filter](https://mame.coffee/collections/coffee/products/el-paraiso-red-filter) | 100% Arabica, Colombia, light roast, natural/fermented, very fruity (<ins>hibiscus/rosehips</ins>, not citrusy), acidic, creamy, low bitter<br/>üåïÔ∏è Coffee-only | Very strong fruit (rosehips, pomegranate) tea like smell, and a _very buttery_, creamy mouth-feel. Covers and clings strangely to the tongue in aftertaste. It is objectively certainly good coffee, very good fruit notes. But subjectively, the creamy buttery aftertaste can be off-putting at first. Fermentation taste is low, which is good.<br/><br/>Waiting a few more days for the beans to degas, and then using C20 with V60 seems to help, there's less creamy buttery mouth-feel now.<br/><br/>:+1: Best with An4msR17C22, pure | An4msR17C20 = 4x<br/>An4msR17C22 = 4x<br/>V60p5R16C28T98 = 3-4x<br/>V60p5R17C20T95 = 4x |

Otherwise nice texture. Note: V60 issue can be solved by going coarser or lowering temp..<br/><br/>This is probably the most versatile, jack-of-all-trades kind of coffee. Sweet but not too much, slightly fruity but not too much, slightly nutty taste but not too much, much cheaper than most other specialty coffee, works with or without milk, good for beginners and with a more "traditional" taste.<br/><br/>:+1: An4msR17C22, and milk<br/>:+1: or E14-18gC9, and milk | Ai3mbR16.6C20 = 4x<br/>An4msR17C22 = 4x<br/>V60p5R17C22T99 = 4x<br/>E14gC9->22s42g = 3x<br/>~E17gC9->24s44g = 2x~<br/>E18gC9->42s43g = 3x |

No unpleasant aftertaste or anything, just a nutty, creamy flavor with some bitterness (but not too much). Me thinks my tastebuds tend to favor darker roasts for Espresso, probably..<br/>C10 took normal shot time, but was slightly more sour. Extracting longer than 2nd angry chimney mutes the sourness a bit, but too long and it gets bitter.<br/>Interestingly not super great with milk, just okay<br/><br/>:+1: Best with E18gC10, longer extraction time,  some grains of iodine salt, and (maybe?) milk | E18gC9->60s32g = 3-4x<br/>E18gC10->28s38g = 3-4x<br/>E18gC10->40s40g = 3-4x<br/>E18gC10->35s42g = 3x |
| [Turm - Brazil - Yellow Bourbon](https://shop.turmkaffee.ch/kaffee/brazil-yellow-burbon.html) | 100% Arabica (Yellow Bourbon), Brazil, medium roast, pulped natural, <ins>nutty</ins>, smokey and creamy chocolate, light fruity, low acidity, low bitter, sweet | pretty "classical" taste profile, nothing standing out too much, a bit rough texture. not smooth/clear, slightly bitter at the very end, with some smokey, creamy hints of chocolate taste. Pear-y body, somewhat stale taste, but mostly harmless..<br/><br/>:+1: Best with An4msR17C22, and a splash of milk | An4msR17C22 = 3-4x<br/>V60p5R17C22T94 = 3-4x |

It's good, but probably not my favorite type. For the occasional urge to drink dark coffee it works reasonably well, and while certainly quite face-punching and astringent it's still within tolerable levels even as a coffee black without milk, etc. Though it's still a good idea to add a splash of milk to mute the bitterness/earthiness.<br/>Also worked okay in a Bialetti, giving a thick, smokey taste together with milk.<br/><br/>:+1: Best with V60p5R17C22T94, and a splash of milk | An4msR17C22 = 3-4x<br/>V60p5R17C22T94 = 3-4x<br/>B = 3-4x |

Ignoring the sourness, it does have a nice nutty-chocolate taste though. C9 however produces a very long shot (1min), overextracted and bitter. Going back to C10 and doing an extra long shot has improved the flavor, still sour but now more balanced by additional sweet- and bitterness. Worked well with milk as a flat-white. | E18gC10->25s42g = 3x<br/>E18gC10->35s45g = 3-4x<br/>E18gC9->60s36g = 2-3x |

But atleast its not yet stale, there's some slight sweet, acidic lemony taste to it thats okay.<br/><br/>If manually sorting out charred beans by hand before each brew is your thing, then I guess this is at least a somewhat okay coffee compared to the other 2 Manana's. But I can't be bothered.. | An4msR16C20 = 3x |

Coffee unfortunately tastes bitter and burnt, some sweetness later into the cup, slightly astringent. It's the same burnt aftertaste as all the other Manana Caf√©s so far, slightly uneven roast containing various charred beans. Not a great roast, and unfortunately I think the beans already went stale too..<br/><br/>It's okay-ish with an AeroPress, but not great... | An4msR16C20 = 2-3x |

The coffee seemed stale and bitter-ish, the smell and taste reminds me of burnt fireworks somehow. (Sulfur?)<br/>Supposedly sweet and fruity, but neither note was present. Only late into the cup at least some slightly chocolatey sweetness developed.<br/>Definitely can't recommend it as a V60...<br/><br/>Tried also as an Espresso, didn't really work well either. Very bitter and acidic at the same time, almost no crema at all (the beans have definitely gone stale).<br/><br/>Very poor quality roast overall, almost a scam to sell this to somebody.. | V60p5R17C24T92 = 2x<br/>E18gC10->20s42g = 2x |
| [Migros - Barista Espresso](https://www.migros.ch/en/product/107112900000) | x% Arabica / x% Robusta, medium roast, earthy, low acidity, bitter | pre-ground bought, medium-fine grind, heavy <ins>woody</ins> and earthy aftertaste, no acidity and fruitiness. okay-ish, but way too bitter (could be prep's fault) | An2mbR16.6 = maybe ok-ish<br/>B = nasty! |

## Usage / Methods - code matrix

- R_ = Ratio, example 16.7 -> 12g/200ml
- A = AeroPress
  - n = normal
  - i = inverted
  - p = PuckPuck cold brew
  - _m|s = time
  - b = +bloom/stir (usually 30-40s)
  - s = +stir at start only
- B = Bialetti / Moka pot
- E = Espresso / 9bar
  - _g _= grams of coffee
  - ->_s_g = shot time and grams of result
- P = E.S.E. pads
- F = French Press
- S = Hario Switch 
- V = Hario V60
  - p_ = number of pours, example: p5 = 1x50g bloom 45s, afterwards 4x50g pours in 10-15s intervals. p5 usually is 50g45s with 4x50, p4 usually is 50g45s with 1x100 and 2x50. p3 is 50g45s with 2x100, p2 is 100g45s with 1x150. Other intervals noted in bean's comment section.
- Ch = Chemex
- C__ = Comandante [C40](https://www.comandantegrinder.com/) click settings
- T__ = temperature in celsius
- üëçÔ∏è = this is how to use that coffee, determined after lengthy research process üòÜ

Note on T__, if omitted it means 100¬∞C for AeroPress, 90¬∞C for V60.

## General notes

Starting points for dialing in:
- C40 clicks for 9barista: 8-12
- C40 clicks for Bialetti: 16-20 (may go as high as 30 though)
- C40 clicks for AeroPress, standard: 16-24
- C40 clicks for AeroPress, inverted: 22-28
- C40 clicks for V60: 22-24 (a bit coarser for darker roasts)

General observations of differences in brewing methods:
- Default AeroPress recipes generally produce a more "clear", smooth, watery, fruity result. Suited well for fruity coffees.
- V60 with high temp produces more "full", dry-mouth, texture, heavy result than AeroPress. Lower temps a more smooth, clear, light and fruity result like AeroPress.
- Bialetti generally produces very heavy, earthy, thick, strong results. Mostly only for milk-required coffees.
- 9barista so far never worked well with light roasts and/or fruity beans, seems to prefer dark and earthy. Suited for darker roasts.

An4msR16C20 vs V60p5R16C23T95:
The basic AeroPress recipe has better citrus taste, less texture, less dry-mouth, more watery but more fruitiness. Overall I think the default AeroPress recipe is "clearer" and better for fruity coffees than default V60 recipe, but V60p5R18C24T94 got close (higher than "normal" ratios seem to make it closer through being more watery?). Overall C22 is probably best for a V60, while C18-20 the best starting point for an AeroPress. It's best to lower temps before grinding coarser on V60 as a first step when experimenting, for example going V60p5R16C22T92. Lower temps tend to push V60 more towards the AeroPress taste profile.

##### Wait time for freshly roasted beans
- Espresso 12 days+
- Filter 5 days+

###### dark roast
- as fresh as possible
- after 1-3 days old it is already beyond the degassing levels of medium and light roasts
- it starts to oxidize and really taste acrid/bitter after a week

###### medium roast
- min. 5-7 days for filter coffee, and 7-10 days for Espresso
- usually lasts at least a month or two before noticeable deterioration of flavours

###### light roast
- 10 - 14 days for filter and 14 days+ for Espressos

#### AeroPress base process:

- put filter in cap, screw cap onto base
- pour coffee into base, 12g, shake to even level
- put base onto cup
- pour hot water into base (95-100c), 200g
- stir with tool for 2-3s (important for even extraction!)
- put plunger in for vacuum
- wait 4min
- gently swirl a few times
- wait 20s
- slowly push plunger, until all water has left (stop at the hiss!)
- done, enjoy! üòã‚òïüëå

---

#### AeroPress milk-drinks process:

- put 2x filter in cap, rinse with water, set aside
- prep inverted method with plunger fully to (1) in base
- grind coffee finer than usual, C12-16
- pour coffee into base, 2x usual amount (preferably use medium to dark roasts)
- pour hot water into base (95-100c), ¬Ω usual amount
- stir with tool for 20s
- screw cap onto base
- press excess air out (otherwise grounds will be stuck to plunger once flipped)
- wait ¬Ω usual amount of time
- flip over onto coffee cup
- push plunger, until all water has left (stop at the hiss!)
- add hot/steamed/foamed milk according to preference
- done, enjoy! üòãü•õüëå

---

#### V60 process:

- base recipe: 15g beans, 250g water, 16.6 ratio
- when in doubt, use C22 as base grind size
- rinse filter paper
- heat water
  - the darker it gets the lower the temps
  - down to 80-85c (maybe up to 90c) for dark roasts
  - 85-95c for medium roasts
  - 90-100c for light roasts
- preheat V60 cup
- put hot V60 cup on caraffe, add rinsed filter paper
- add coffee, dig small mound in middle
- 0:00 - pour 50g (use simple circular pouring for all pours!)
- 0:10-0:15 - gently swirl
- reset time (makes keeping track easier for the intervals)
- 0:00-0:45 - bloom
- 0:45-1:00 - pour 50g (100g total)
- 1:00-1:10 - wait
- 1:10-1:20 - pour 50g (150g total)
- 1:20-1:30 - wait
- 1:30-1:40 - pour 50g (200g total)
- 1:40-1:50 - wait
- 1:50-2:00 - pour 50g (250g total)
- 2:00-2:05 - gently swirl
- 2:05-3:00 - let it drain
- 3:00+ - should be done roughly after hitting the 3min. mark
  - Note: as a general rule, lighter roasts tend to have longer drawdown times, darker roasts are quicker. (Has something to do with fines production in the Comandante I guess) 
- done, enjoy! üòã‚òïüëå

#### 9barista process:

- don't push rubber cover on portafilter basket all the way in, ideally it shouldn't touch the puck
- without adaptor-plate on smallest glass-ceramic
- set to highest heat
- wait till first angry steam blow from chimney
- see Espresso appearing and start timer
- ~25-35s later the second angry steam blow from chimney should happen / have happened by then
- immediately take off of heat once second angry steam blow subsides, stop timer
  - _new finding!_ -> don't immediately take it off heat, wait a few seconds to extract more bitter-balance into a sour shot üòãüëå
- pour shot into glass
- enjoy! (or not.. ü§£)
